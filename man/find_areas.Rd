\title{Find areas of land masses.}
\usage{
find_areas(occs, area_custom = NULL, shapefile = NULL, names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{occs}{The dataframe that is returned by \code{ssarp::find_land()}. If using
a custom occurrence record dataframe, ensure that it has the following
columns: "genericName", "specificEpithet",
"decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude", "first", "second", "third",
"datasetKey". The "datasetKey" column is important for GBIF records and
identifies the dataset to which the occurrence record belongs. Custom
dataframes without this style of data organization should fill the column
with placeholder values.}

\item{area_custom}{A dataframe including names of land masses and their
associated areas. This dataframe should be provided when the user would like
to bypass using the built-in database of island names and areas. Please
ensure that the custom dataframe includes the land mass's area in a column
called "AREA" and the name in a column called "Name". (Optional)}

\item{shapefile}{A shapefile (.shp) containing spatial information for
the geographic locations of interest. (Optional)}

\item{names}{If the user would like to restrict which polygons in the
shapefile are included in the returned occurrence record dataframe, they can
be specified here as a vector. If the user does not provide a vector, all of
the non-NA names in the shapefile will be included
(as found in shapefile$name). (Optional)}
}
\value{
A dataframe of the species name, island name, and island area
}
\description{
Find the areas of the land masses relevant to the taxon of interest with two
options: a database of island names and areas, or a user-provided shapefile.
}
\details{
The first method is to reference a built-in dataset of island names
and areas to find the areas of the landmasses relevant to the taxon of
interest. The user may also decide to input their own custom dataframe
including names of relevant land masses and their associated areas to
bypass using \emph{ssarp}'s built-in dataset.

The second method is to reference a user-supplied shapefile containing
spatial information for the landmasses of interest in order to determine
their areas.

While the word "landmasses" was used heavily in this documentation, users
supplying their own custom area dataframe or shapefile are encouraged to
use this function in the \emph{ssarp} workflow to create species- and speciation-
area relationships for island-like systems such as lakes, fragmented habitat,
and mountain peaks.
