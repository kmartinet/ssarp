\title{Create a presence-absence dataframe for a given occurrence record dataframe}
\usage{
get_presence_absence(occs)
}
\arguments{
\item{occs}{The dataframe output by \code{ssarp::find_areas()}, or if using a
custom dataframe, ensure that it has the following named columns:
\itemize{
\item "areas" containing the areas associated with the land masses of interest
\item "specificEpithet" containing the names of the species living on those
islands
\item "first" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
column contains the country name
\item "second" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
column contains a province or island name
\item "third" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
column contains the island name if the 7th column does not contain the
island name
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with a row for each island in the given occurrence
record dataframe and a column for each species. Within each species column,
a 1 represents the presence of that species on the island corresponding to
the given row, and a 0 represents the absence of that species on the island
corresponding to the given row.
}
\description{
Use a dataframe output by \code{ssarp::find_areas()} to determine which species
occur on specific islands by creating a presence-absence dataframe. A 1
represents presence and a 0 represents absence.
