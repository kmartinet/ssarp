\usage{
estimate_ms(tree, label_type = "binomial", occurrences)

estimate_MS(tree, label_type = "binomial", occurrences)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The dated phylogenetic tree that corresponds with the taxa to be
included in a speciation-area relationship}

\item{label_type}{Either "epithet" or "binomial" (default): describes the
type of tip label in the provided tree. If "epithet," only the species
epithet will be used when interacting with the tree. If "binomial," the full
species name (including genus) will be used when interacting with the tree.}

\item{occurrences}{The occurrence record dataframe output from the ssarp
pipeline. If you would like to use a custom dataframe, please make sure that
there are columns titled "specificEpithet", "genericName", and "areas"}
}
\value{
A dataframe that includes speciation rates for each island in the
user-provided occurrence record dataframe.
}
\description{
Use methodology from Magallon and Sanderson (2001) to estimate speciation
rates using a user-provided phylogeny and output a dataframe for use in
ssarp's speciation-area relationship pipeline. This method also removes any
species rows without rates (this is most likely to occur when the tree does
not have all of the species included in the occurrence record dataframe)
