\title{Get speciation rates using the DR statistic (Jetz et al. 2012)}
\usage{
estimate_dr(tree, label_type = "binomial", occurrences)

estimate_DR(tree, label_type = "binomial", occurrences)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The dated phylogenetic tree that corresponds with the taxa to be
included in a speciation-area relationship}

\item{label_type}{Either "epithet" or "binomial" (default): describes the
type of tip label in the provided tree. If "epithet," only the species
epithet will be used to match speciation rates to tips in the returned
occurrence dataframe. If "binomial," the full species name (including genus)
will be used to match speciation rates to tips in the returned occurrence
dataframe.}

\item{occurrences}{The occurrence record dataframe output from the ssarp
pipeline. If you would like to use a custom dataframe, please make sure that
there are columns titled "genericName" and "specificEpithet"}
}
\value{
A dataframe that includes speciation rates for each species in the
occurrence record dataframe
}
\description{
DR stands for “diversification rate,” but it is ultimately a better
estimation of speciation rate than net diversification (Belmaker and Jetz
2015; Quintero and Jetz 2018) and returns results similar to BAMM’s tip
speciation rate estimations (Title and Rabosky 2019).
}
\details{
This function uses methodology from Sun and Folk (2020) to calculate the DR
statistic for each tip of a given tree and output a dataframe for use in
ssarp's speciation-area relationship pipeline. This method also removes any
species rows without rates (this is most likely to occur when the tree does
not have all of the species included in the occurrence record dataframe).
The tree read in the examples below is modified from Patton et al. (2021).
